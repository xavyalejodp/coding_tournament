Introduction
======

Deliktum.com is a free platform for the public to report crimes on Quito. This platform was also changed a bit
to be used in the last earthquake in Ecuador. The technologies and stacks used at the time were Google Maps,
JS Backbone and Ruby on Rails.

![](docs/screens/main.png?raw=true)

The main idea is to revamp Deliktum using a modern approach and stack.

Specs
======

A simple functional UI experience is expected without emulating or doing a pixel perfect implementation on how
Deliktum currently looks.

1.- The main view of the app should be the map that is zoomed automatically to show all events displayed
in the map. Render a Map component that let you click on certain points on the map to retrieve the 
location information and also click on displayed items that show the detailed information of an event.

2.- Events in the map should be clustered depending on Zoom level.

![](docs/screens/cluster.png?raw=true)

3.- There should be a button to report an event, clicking on it should open the form to create an 
event (Panel should slide from right, open in a modal or something else, be creative!)
Use the following fields:

- Description (Text field)
- Type of event (Relationship to an Entity for type of events)
- Date and time of the event (default value is current time, but user can select a different date 
from the past)
- Location (User should click on map to get location - latitude,longitude -)
- Image

4.- As a user I should be able to filter the events by type of event or point in time 
(all, today, last week, last month, last year).

![](docs/screens/filter.png?raw=true)

5.- There should be a Feed sidebar that displays the last 10 events with option 
to load more. If I click on an event in this feed the main map zooms and the Info window is opened automatically.

6.- Every event needs a unique URL to be easily shared to other persons. This unique URl zooms
the map and opens an Event Info Window automatically.

7.- Extra Points:

- Retrieve user current location and zoom to the location
- Use Material Design, Semantic-UI, Bootstrap, etc...
- Responsive
- Configurable to use in other cities/regions
- Multilingual support
- Automatic Testing
